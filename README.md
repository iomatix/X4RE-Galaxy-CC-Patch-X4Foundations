### Patch Overview
This patch aims to provide **optimal compatibility** between **X4: Reemergence** and **Rise of the Ossian Raider**, while also ensuring support for additional content, including official and community expansions for X4RE, as well as officially supported community sector addons.

### Supported Mods
- **X4: Reemergence**
- **Rise of the Ossian Raider**
- **Trey's Sectors Reemergence Patch Standalone**
- **X4: RE Expansion - Skull and Bones**

### Future Adaptation
- Will be continuously updated to align with official **X4RE** and **RoR** releases.
- Supports official **X4RE** expansions and community sector addons.
- Additional mods may be integrated into the patch to further improve compatibility.

### Requesting Additional Mods
- You may request any mod that **expands X4 Universe** and is **compatible with the latest release of VRO** (because VRO is hard dependency for Reemergence).
