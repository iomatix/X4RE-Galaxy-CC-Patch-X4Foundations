# X4RE-RoR-Patch-X4Foundations

### Patch Overview
This patch aims to provide **optimal compatibility** between **X4: Reemergence** and **Rise of the Ossian Raider**, while also ensuring support for additional content, including official and community expansions for X4RE, as well as officially supported community sector addons.

### Requirements
- **X4: Reemergence**
- **Rise of the Ossian Raider**
- **Trey's Sectors Reemergence Patch Standalone**
